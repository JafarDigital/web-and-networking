# Web & Networking Lab

This repository is a personal hands-on lab containing a series of small, focused Python projects for practicing **backend development**, **HTTP fundamentals**, **networking**, and **automation**.

Each project is self-contained and aims to build fluency with real-world tools and libraries commonly used in web backend and system-level tasks.

## Concepts Covered

- RESTful APIs (GET, POST, headers, status codes)
- GraphQL API
- Basic server-client architecture
- HTTP requests and web protocols
- TCP socket programming
- Process management and automation
- API integration and scripting
- Minimal FastAPI apps
- Command-line scripting with argparse
